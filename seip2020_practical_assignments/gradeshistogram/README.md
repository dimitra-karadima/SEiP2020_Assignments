# Histogram generator

A project creating a histogram from a given txt file filled with grades.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you the Histogram generator up and running. We suppose that you have everything you need already from the main README file.

## Deployment

We assume that you already followed the steps shown in the corresponding section of the main README file. You now have to follow the bellow steps:
1. Enter in the folder gradeshistogram/target with: ```cd gradeshistogram/target```.
2. Run the program by entering in the command line: ```java -jar gradeshistogram-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar``` and the path to the txt file you want to read. For example: ```java -jar gradeshistogram-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar C://Temp//grades.txt```

The program will now run and generate a histogram based on the folder you gave as an input.
